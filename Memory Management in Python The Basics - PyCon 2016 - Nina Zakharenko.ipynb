    "# Variable\n",
    "* Python has names (not variables)\n",
    "* We have names -> references -> objects\n",
    "* Name is just a label for an object; in python, each object can have lots of names\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different types of objects\n",
    "**Simple**\n",
    "* numbers\n",
    "* strings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Containers**\n",

    "* Name or container object that points at another object\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference Count?\n",
    "* Number of references that you have to any object\n",
    "* We can increase the reference count by doing something as simple as `x=300`, `y=300`, the object `300` has 2 references\n",
    "* We can decrease the ref count using `del`, e.g. `del x`\n",
    "* What does `del` do?\n",
    "    * Does not delete the object\n",
    "    * removes that name a sa reference to that object\n",
    "    * Hence reduces the ref count\n",
    "* We can also change reference count by setting it to something directly, e.g. `y = None`, so we deleted the reference `x` by using `del x` and then set `y` to `None`, now there are no more references to the object `300`\n",
    "* Now, zero references to object `300` hence we don't care if it exists anymore, hence it can be safely removed from the memory later one\n",
    "* We can also decreate ref count by going out of scope\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def print_word():\n",

    "\n",
    "# at this stage, ref count is decreased to zero since we are no longer in scope of function `print_word`\n",

    "* Finally, when a program exits, the reference count is decreased too since we simply have no more references\n",
    "* **local vs global namespace**\n",
    "    - Global namespace objects might never go out of scope and their ref count never reaches 0\n",
    "    - Avoid putting large/complex objects in global namespace\n",
    "    - So, avoid putting objects in global namespace and if you do, set their reference count to 0 by calling `del` on them\n",

    "\n",
    "* Reference Counting\n",
    "* Tracing\n",
    "**Python uses both**\n",
    "* How does reference counting gc work?\n",
    "    - Add/remove references, ref count ++ on assignment and -- on `del` or any of the other operations that reduce ref count\n",
    "    - When ref count reaches 0, the object is deleted\n",
    "        - Cascading effect - Other objects that the deleted object pointed to, if that object's ref count reaches 0, those objects are deleted too\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good**\n",
    "- Easy to implement\n",
    "- When refcount == 0, objects are immediately deleted\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad**\n",
    "- Space overhead, ref count for every object takes some data space\n",
    "- Execution overhead, ref count changes on every assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ugly**\n",
    "- Not generally thread safe \n",
    "- Reference counting garbage collection doesn't detect cyclical references\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cyclical reference by example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Node:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def next(self, next)\n",
    "        self.next = next)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The node class contains a value and a reference to the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Let us declare a root, left and right nodes\n",
    "root = Node('root')\n",
    "left = Node('left')\n",
    "right = Node('right')\n",
    "\n",
    "root.next(left)\n",
    "left.next(right)\n",
    "right.next(left)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ref cout of root: 1 (referred by `root`)\n",
    "# Ref count of left: 3 (referred by `left`, `root` and `right`)\n",
    "# Ref count of right: 2 (referred by `right`, `left`)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Now as we `del` the names;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "del root\n",
    "del left\n",
    "del right\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Althought we remove the names, the internal references (`.next`) is still there\n",
    "- So the ref count of `root` is 0, by ref count of `left` and `right` (referred by `right.next` and `left.next` respectively) remains 1\n",
    "- **Ref counting alone will not gc objects with cyclical references**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tracing Garbage Collection\n",
    "- So let us look at another type of gc in Python, called **Tracing**\n",
    "- Algo used: **Mark and Sweep**\n",
    "    -  Start from root node and mark any objects whose references are found _(this algo is run when references reach a certain threshold)_\n",
    "    - Next: Sweep - When marking is done, **Sweep** phase will remove the dead objects\n",
    "    - This includes deletion of cyclical references too\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does Python use?\n",
    "- It uses **Reference Counting** and also a strategy called **Generational**\n",
    "- **Generational** is a type of **Tracing Garbage Collection**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generational Garbage Collection\n",
    "- Based on theory **most objects die young**\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "    - Frequently objects are created, often temporary which are used once or a few times and then never used again\n",
    "- Python maintains list of every object created as a program is run\n",
    "- It actually makes three lists:\n",
    "    - generation 0\n",
    "    - generation 1\n",
    "    - generation 2\n",
    "- Newly created objects are stored in _generation 0_\n",
    "- Each object is stored in only one generation and we optimize by collecting objects in _generation 0_ more frequently than the other generations\n",
    "- **Remember**: Only container objects with a refcount > 0 are stored in a generation list.\n",
    "- So similar to Mark and Sweep, but we only keep the ones with active references - this means, fewer objects are tracked and scanned.\n",
    "- When number of objects in a generation reaches a threshold, python runs gc algo on that generation, and on any generations younger than it.\n",
    "    - So if we run on generation 2, we are actually collecting on generation 0, 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens during a generational garbage collection cycle?**\n",
    "    - Python makes a list of objects to discard\n",
    "    - Runs an algorithm to detect reference cycles\n",
    "    - If an object has no outside references, it's put on the discard list\n",
    "    - When the cycle is done, it frees up the objects on the discard list\n",
    "\n",
    "- After gc cycle, objects that survived are promoted to the next generation\n",
    "- Objects in the last generation (generation 2) stay there as the program executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Big Idea:**\n",
    "    - When ref count reaches 0, we get immediate clean up\n",
    "    - But if we have objects with cyclical references, we will need for gc to run, and in order for that to happen, we will have to wait.\n",
    "    - So if we have cyclical refs, it can potentially slow down our progam.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Reference Counting Gotchas\n",
    "- Not generally thread safe\n",
    "    - Think what happens if two threads try to increase and decrease ref count at the same time\n",
    "- Remember cylical refs `left.next` and `right.next`? They will be cleaned up by generational gc **EXCEPT in python2** if they have a `__del__` method.\n",
    "    - This is fixed as of Python 3.4\n",
    "- What is `__del__` magic method?\n",
    "    - Sometimes called a `destructor`\n",
    "    - **NOT** the `del` statement - this is not invoked when `del` statement is called\n",
    "    - This is only called when the reference count for an object reaches 0\n",
    "    - So this is ran before an object is removed from memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy to improve mem usage: `__slots__`\n",
    "#### What are `__slots__`?**\n",
    "- Python class instances contain dictionary of its names and values, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Dog(object):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "buddy = Dog()\n",
    "buddy.name = 'Buddy'\n",
    "\n",
    "print(buddy.__dict__)\n",
    "{'name': 'Buddy'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `__slots__` turns the internal dictionary to tuples, tuples are immutables.\n",
    "- `__slots__` prevents us from setting attributes on instances\n",
    "- So for example, I can use `__slots__` to prevent setting unnecessary attributes on a class, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Point:\n",
