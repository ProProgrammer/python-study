    "**Primary thoughts:**\n",
    "- People often get caught up in the details of PEP8 without really focussing on the central idea of PEP8.\n",
    "- Many want to strictly follow the PEP8 guidelines but compromise on other basic things such as naming variables such that the overall statement size is less than 80 characters just so that PEP8 guidelines are met\n",
    "- At places like Google, some teams decided to change the indentation levels to 2 spaces instead of 4 spaces just so they can stay under the PEP8 line size guidelines but they missed the point of not hurting the code readability.\n",
    "- People often try to contribute to code bases and the lowest hanging fruits they find is to make PEP8 corrections and submit a patch for that. This unnecessarily messes up the git history of the files and oftentimes noob programmers end up introducing bugs in the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**More importantly:**\n",
    "- When people are focussed on PEP8 checking, they aren't necessarily focussed on making the code better, they are instead focussed on just minor PEP8 checks\n",
    "- They miss the point of reviewing the code from the perspective of p vs np (pythonic vs non-pythonic)\n",
    "- They miss the gorilla in the room while chasing minute details that doesn't at all add value to the code base.\n",
    "- Additionally, this puts pressure on the writers of the code to write PEP8 specific code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> _PEP8 is a guideline not a rulebook, it should be followed as such._\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python vs Non-Pythonic Code**\n",
    "- Raymond talks about focussing on making the code better by means of reviewing code from the eyes of making it Pythonic.\n",
    "- He shares examples of some legacy libraries which has methods like `getRouteByIndex()`, `getName()`, `getSizeOf()`, etc. - methods like these can be easily made pythonic by introducing methods like `__getitem__()` and `__len__`\n",
    "- When you have repeated pieces of code doing something as `tearDown` part of an operatiion, you can create a class and have `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods to that class so that it can be used with a context manager as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "with NetworkElement(127.0.0.1) as ne:\n",
    "\t<do Something>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the above snippet, whatever code is defined in the `__enter__` method of `NetworkElement` class will be executed as the `with` statement is entered and by the team the `with` context manager is done executing, towards the end, whatever code is defined in `__exit__` method of `NetworkElement` class, will be executed.\n",
    "- This makes code much more readable and removes the need for duplications througout.\n",
    "- Raymond mentions about `import` statements where the example shows multiple imports spread across three lines in a single `import` statement as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import jnettool.tools.elements.NetworkElement, \\\n",
    "\t   jnettool.tools.Routing, \\\n",
    "\t   jnettool.tools.RouteInspector\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- This can easily be changed to something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import jnettool.tools.elements.NetworkElement\n",
    "import jnettool.tools.Routing\n",
    "import jnettool.tools.RouteInspector\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sample code shown has unnecessary three single quotes around strings, and too many comments before each statement stating the obvious - such things can easily be gotten rid off.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modifying a legacy API into a Pythonic API**\n",
    "- Raymond talks about writing wrapper class over legacy APIs so that the overall code is more maintainable, easy to read, pythonic by using adapter pattern.\n",
    "- He converts the legacy API above `jnettool.tools.elements.NetworkElement` into a class named `NetworkElement` which is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
